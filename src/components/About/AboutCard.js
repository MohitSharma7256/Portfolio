            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Mohit Sharma </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Gopalganj, India.</span>
            <br /><br />
            I have completed a 3-month internship as a MERN Stack Developer.
            <br /><br />
            As a recent graduate with a 3-month internship experience in MERN stack development, I bring a fresh perspective, eagerness to learn, and dedication to growth. With a solid foundation in MERN technologies gained through hands-on experience during my internship, along with a strong motivation to contribute, I am poised to make meaningful contributions to the team.
            <br /><br />
            I have completed my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computing at Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur.
